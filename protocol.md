# Development Protocol

Add a protocol document with the following content:
- Description of technical steps and architecture decisions
- Explanation of unit test coverage and why specific logic was tested
- Notes on problems encountered and how they were solved
- Estimated time tracking for each major part of the project
- consider that the git-history is part of the documentation (no need to copy it into the
protocol)
  
See the corresponding Checklist Excel sheets for the MUST-HAVES, Grading-Items and
  Grading-Points.
